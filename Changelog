Version 0.0.01 (12/9/17) -
    1) Added *Income Class and *Expenses Class
       a) Income Class
            - Added getter
            - Added money and name variables
            - Added Constructor
       b) Expenses Class
            - Added getter
            - Added money and name variables
            - Added Constructor
    2) Added *Main Class

    Programmer Comments:
    This is a very basic bare bones structure of what "Cash Money" will contain. Needless to say that it is very possible that there will be more
    classes to make the main method more clean. May add setter methods for *Income and *Expenses method to possibly simplify process of entering information.

Version 0.9.0 (12/27/17) -
    1) Added Budget Sheet Class
        a) addIncome method
        b) addExpenses method
        c) containsIncome method
        d) containsExpenses method
        e) removeIncome method
        f) removeExpenses method
        g) totalIncome method
        h) totalExpenses method
        i) writeFile method
    2) Finished Main Class
        a) Added multiple GUI methods

    Programmer Comments:
    This program is nearly finished but requires some bug fixes and some final adjustments. Most methods are self explanatory while the
    writeFile method makes a directory in the users Desktop where every file will be made there. Currently there is no way to show the user the data upon
    completion without having to go the users Desktop and view it from there. May work on that.
